# Cat Energy — Adaptive Layout Course Project

📌 Description  
Final course project from HTML Academy "Adaptive Layout and Automation". Built a responsive website adapting a desktop-first design into a mobile-friendly version, using modern tools and automation workflows.

🛠 Tech stack  
- HTML5, CSS3 (responsive, adaptive techniques)  
- Less (CSS preprocessor)  
- Basic JavaScript (interactivity)  
- Gulp build process (automating compilation, minification)

👩‍💻 My role  
- Translated desktop layout into adaptive, mobile-first design  
- Styled using Less for maintainable and scalable CSS  
- Added simple JS for UX interactions  
- Set up Gulp tasks: compiling, autoprefixing, minification, live-reload

🚀 How to run  
1. Install dependencies: npm install  
2. Run dev server: gulp serve  
3. Build for production: gulp build

💡 What I learned  
- Adaptive design approaches (CSS media queries, breakpoints)  
- Workflow automation with Gulp (Less → CSS, minification, live reload)  
- Structuring code for maintainability  
- Working within course project constraints and naming schemes
